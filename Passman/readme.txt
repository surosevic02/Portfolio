This is my personal password manager project,
it is created in C++ using the Win32 API for the
frontend and OpenSSL API for the back end.
Other things I would've done, would
be to  create a Linux front end using POSIX

OpenSSL library x64 Debug and Release is needed in order to
compile the source code
