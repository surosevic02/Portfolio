This is my personal password manager project,
it is created in C++ using the Win32 API for the
frontend and OpenSSL API for the back end. This was
made on a Windows 11 machine and is compatible with
Windows 11 only. Other things I would've done, would
be to include Windows 10 compatibility and to create
a Linux front end using POSIX
