Hey Stefan!

Great job on your lab.
In the future, for the case of your grades lab,
I recommend telling the user what the exit token (in this case -1) is.
Also, I encourage you to get into exception handling, whether it being using
conditional statements or the try, throw, and catch keywords which you can look up
how to use in the official Java documentation.


In the case of your grades program, how can you handle numbers > 100?
A simple conditional could ensure a user does not enter these values
and can return a message to them.
