# Lab 6 - Lists

## 11/02/2020

## Objectives

1.  Learn to write and use an ArrayList declaration
2.  Learn to manipulate the data in an ArrayList

## Exercise

In this assignment, you will take your solution to the previous lab and modify it to use an ArrayList instead of an array. You should also remove the limit of 5 `Trip`s, add an option to view the details of a single trip (but not take it), and add a menu option to remove an existing trip. This means that your application should have a menu like the following:

```
1. Create a Trip
2. Remove a Trip
3. View a Trip
4. Take all Trips
5. Exit
```
