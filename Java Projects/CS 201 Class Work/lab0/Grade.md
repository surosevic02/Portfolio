Hi Stefan!

Great job on your first lab!
All of your programs produce the correct output and your pseudocode looked great.
In the future I do you encourage to provide documentation for each of your programs,
but due to the fact that these ones are fairly simple I only took off 1 point.
Explaining what is going on in your code is immensely important.
Additionally, please add headers to at least one, if not all, of your files.
I do consider this documentation as well.

Additionally, your Square program produces a rectangle and not a square, but your implementation provides an easy way to fix this.

I encourage you down the road to consider how you can find a more general and less hard coded solution to creating squares.
Getting into the habit of creating general solutions will make your code easier to implement in the future
and will be less likely to produce errors.
For example, using a method in which the user can pass an argument for the size of the desired square. 

Again, great job on your first lab and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
